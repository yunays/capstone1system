# Student Cancellation & Admin Notifications Feature

## Overview
Two major email features have been implemented:

1. **Student Cancellation Email** - When students cancel pending consultation requests, instructors receive email notifications
2. **Admin Action Notifications** - Admins receive emails for every major consultation action (submit, cancel, approve, decline, call)

## What's New

### Student Cancellation Feature
When a **student cancels a pending consultation request**:
- ✅ In-app notification sent to instructor (real-time)
- ✅ **NEW:** Email sent to instructor with cancellation details
- ✅ **NEW:** Email sent to all admin users

### Admin Notifications
Admins now receive emails for **every major action**:

| Action | Triggered By | Recipients |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Consultation Submitted | Student | Instructor + All Admins |
| Consultation Cancelled | Student | Instructor + All Admins |
| Consultation Approved | Instructor | Student + All Admins |
| Consultation Declined | Instructor | Student + All Admins |
| Video Call Started | Instructor | Student + All Admins |

## Files Created

### Email Classes
- **`app/Mail/StudentCancellationMail.php`** - Handles cancellation notifications to instructors
- **`app/Mail/AdminActionMail.php`** - Generic admin action notifications for all events

### Email Templates
- **`resources/views/emails/student_cancellation.blade.php`** - Professional cancellation email
- **`resources/views/emails/admin_action.blade.php`** - Admin dashboard email with action details

### Routes Updated
- **Cancellation route** - Now sends 2 emails (instructor + all admins)
- **Submission route** - Now sends email to all admins
- **Approve route** - Now sends email to all admins
- **Decline route** - Now sends email to all admins
- **Call start route** - Now sends email to all admins

### Test Routes Added

- `GET /email-test/admin-action` - Test admin action email

## Email Templates Details

### Student Cancellation Email
- **Recipient:** Instructor
- **When:** Student cancels a pending consultation
- **Content:**
  - Cancellation alert
  - Student name
  - Original consultation date/time
  - Consultation type
  - Status badge showing "CANCELLED"
  - Next steps guidance

### Admin Action Email
- **Recipient:** All admin users
- **When:** Any major consultation action (5 types)
- **Content:**
  - Action type badge (color-coded)
  - Who performed the action
  - Who is affected
  - Consultation details (date, time, type, mode)
  - Action description
  - Timestamp
  - Admin tip to check dashboard

## How It Works

### Example: Student Cancels a Consultation
```
1. Student clicks "Cancel" on pending consultation
2. System updates status to 'cancelled'
3. In-app notification created for instructor (real-time)
4. Email sent to instructor: StudentCancellationMail
5. Email sent to all admins: AdminActionMail (action_type: 'cancelled')
6. Student redirected to dashboard
```

### Example: Admin Monitoring
Admins can now monitor all platform activity via email:
- New consultation submissions (track request volume)
- Cancellations (understand demand patterns)
- Approval/Decline decisions (track instructor activity)
- Call initiations (verify sessions are starting on time)

## Configuration

No additional configuration needed! The system automatically:
- ✅ Finds all admin users (user_type = 'admin')
- ✅ Sends emails to all of them (cc'd effectively)
- ✅ Works with any mail driver (Gmail, SendGrid, Mailtrap, etc.)
- ✅ Respects existing email configuration in `.env`

## Testing

### Test All New Emails Locally
```bash
# Test student cancellation email to instructor
curl http://localhost:8000/email-test/student-cancellation

# Test admin action email (simulates submission)
curl http://localhost:8000/email-test/admin-action

# Check mail configuration
curl http://localhost:8000/email-test/status
```

### Expected Response
```json
{
    "status": "success",
    "message": "Student cancellation email sent to instructor@example.com",
    "template": "student_cancellation",
    "recipient": "instructor@example.com",
    "student": "John Doe",
    "consultation_date": "2026-03-15"
}
```

## Production Readiness

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions (not implemented yet):
